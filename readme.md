# Defend Ukraine - game

Group of Ukraine soldiers was heading back to the military base,
while their road were crossed with separatists near Donetsk.
After heavy battle, you were the only survivor...

Separatists backup has just arrived, so you have to hold the
last line and keep your ***flashlight*** working!

## Browser support

Should work with most of the latest browsers Chrome 39, Firefox 34, IE 11. There are issues with the "fullscreen mode" on Firefox and IE.
